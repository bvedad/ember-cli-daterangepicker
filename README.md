# ember-cli-daterangepicker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/josemarluedke/ember-cli-daterangepicker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/josemarluedke/ember-cli-daterangepicker)

Just a simple component to use [daterangepicker](https://github.com/dangrossman/daterangepicker).

## :exclamation: Important notice

The use of this addon is **no longer recommended**. This addon is a very simple
wrapper for another JS library that requires `jQuery` and `moment.js`.

Another more modern option for building powerful calendar is [`ember-power-calendar`](https://github.com/cibernox/ember-power-calendar).

## Installation

```
ember install ember-cli-daterangepicker
```

## Usage

```handlebars
{{date-range-picker
  label='Optional label'
  start="20150101"
  end="20151231"
  applyAction=(action "setDateRange")
  hideAction=(action "hideDatePicker")
  cancelAction=(action "cancelDatePicker")
}}
```

This addon supports many of the same options as the [daterangepicker](https://github.com/dangrossman/daterangepicker) library. These options are documented here: [http://www.daterangepicker.com/#options](http://www.daterangepicker.com/#options). Open up an issue if you find an option that does not work with this addon.

`applyAction`, `hideAction`, and `cancelAction` will bubble up to the named function on nearest controller, etc, like normal. All are optional, but you won't have any way to get your date if you don't specify an `applyAction`.

## Running Tests

* `yarn test` (Runs `ember try:each` to test your addon against multiple Ember versions)
